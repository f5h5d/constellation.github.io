        Personal sovereignty was not a concept I was aware of before this unit,
        but as I learned more, I realised how important having personal
        sovereignty is to me: I like having control over my life and
        decision-making. I took it for granted and did not appreciate how not
        having control over my decisions could impact my identity: I could not
        imagine living a life where I was denied education or the freedom of
        choosing my career path. Unfortunately, the poem “Future We In-U-Wee” by
        Dr. Norma Dunning outlines the lack of freedom that Inuit people have
        over their own life: they are told to never “dream of a future“ or “make
        a better life for [themselves]” (Dunning 50-51). Dunning speaks about
        the lack of support or personal sovereignty that Inuit people are given.
        Despite the lack of infrastructure or job opportunities that Inuit
        communities receive, the Canadian government has been batting an eye
        similar to how they have been sweeping Thomas Moore Keesick’s story
        under the rug. Thinking in the shoes of an Inuit person, even if I
        wanted to take control of my own life by trying to get a higher
        education, I would not be given ample opportunities to obtain a quality
        education, directly reducing the likelihood of getting employed, and
        further reducing my freedom. The current Canadian government is catering
        to the majority of people and paying no attention to the Inuit people,
        but also Indigenous peoples as a whole. If they were to utilise the
        Indigenous concept of Two-Eyed-Seeing, where they take the perspective
        of both themselves and also the Indigenous peoples, they would
        understand how unfair it must feel to live as “Canada’s biggest
        afterthought” (50). From the perspective of an Inuit person, they have
        done nothing wrong to deserve this terrible treatment. They have had a
        history filled with mental and physical trauma alongside having families
        ripped apart and despite how many years have passed, they are still
        treated as a burden. It is not a coincidence that the suicide rate of
        Inuit people is up to 25 times more than the general population. With
        the lack of any therapy or support at all, I truthfully could see myself
        breaking and giving in if I were to live in such an oppressive system.
        Through the constant repetition that Dunning uses, I feel more impact
        from each of these lines.

        />The repetition of “freak” creates a mood of
        not belonging and being treated as an outsider, which is ironic in that
        the Inuit are one of if not the first known inhabitants of Canada: they
        are being treated as outsiders in their own country. Additionally, the
        poem exhibits reflective tones of frustration and resentment when
        discussing the harsh treatment and racism that Inuit people face
        constantly. We as the next generation need to change the way Inuit
        people are viewed and give back their sovereignty: we need to treat them
        as people and give them access to higher education. Through Dunning’s
        poem, I have learned about the lack of say that Inuit people have had in
        their life and how lucky I am to be able to choose to go to a university
        or to be able to afford a house. These things that seemed normal to me
        are a challenge for many Inuit people who are treated unjustly. Moving
        forward I will not take anything I have for granted.

          the case that industrial schools and residential schools are working
          well. And at the time, I think they thought these two pictures made it

        Before watching the podcast episode, “The Boy In The Picture '', I would
        never have guessed that it would bring political feelings out of me and
        help me to begin to understand my political identity. When hearing the
        title, for some odd reason it felt like a title that I had heard before:
        I had to search it up out of curiosity and when I did, I saw an iconic
        image, one that I had seen many times in the past. Despite having seen
        it so many times, I struggled to remember anything about the person, or
        what the image was for. But because of my ignorance, I was jumping out
        of my skin while listening to the podcast. I learned that the image was
        “two black and white pictures taken years apart featuring the same child
        with a title that reads before and after… His name was Thomas Moore
        Keesick” (The Secret Life Of Canada 0:20 - 0:29). The tone of the
        authors used when discussing the whole situation was overall negative.
        This negative tone influenced me to care more about this issue as
        without their negative tone, I would have forgotten about the podcast
        episode. The sadness and disgust that they displayed is something I
        still remember. Hearing about his name, his tragic story, and how the
        government is trying to cover it up was all very saddening. Learning how
        the government has been sweeping this whole situation under a rug was
        honestly both horrific and irritating: I wondered in my head if the
        current government is as inclusive and for the people as they claim to
        be, “surely there is someone that could better lead and represent this
        country?” I thought to myself. The great exposition of the authors
        helped tremendously when trying to understand their viewpoints. The
        background information that they provided was very helpful to me as it
        gave me context on the situation at hand that helped me to formulate an
        opinion: Thomas’s Indigenous identity was taken away from him, and
        transformed into one of a white person: he was whitewashed. His name,
        his culture, and his heritage were all stripped away and forgotten: the
        only evidence of his existence is the propaganda image. Thomas was
        dehumanised, similar to the dehumanisation in Hunting By Stars when the
        captured Indigenous people are referred to as numbers instead of actual
        names. They are stripped of human contact, treated worse than animals,
        and talked about like merchandise.

        />The government in Hunting By Stars heavily alludes to the government
        that was present in the time of Thomas and thus he was treated just as
        terribly as the residents. But, the fact that Thomas’s name is being
        spread more in recent times brings hope for the future and the potential
        for the government to have no choice but to acknowledge Thomas’s past.
        Through this podcast episode, I learned about a more politically
        critical side of my identity which led to me doing more research about
        the different political parties and what they stand for to get a better
        grasp and understanding of where I stand. I appreciate the creators of
        the podcast trying to bring this issue into the limelight and exposing
        yet another terrible thing that we as Canada should be ashamed of.

      Reading The Marrow Thieves opened my eyes to the significance of identity: identity is a topic that is relevant
      throughout the whole novel. The struggle the characters constantly go through to preserve their culture made me
      wonder more about my own heritage; up until then, I did not value my culture, but during my reading, I had moments
      of reflection. Moments of reflection where I thought about my culture and how it shapes me as a person: I realised
      the effects it has on my habits and decision-making. Through my newfound realisation, I was able to sympathise
      with Dimaline’s characters and their fight to preserve their identity. My perception of Frenchie during the
      beginning of the novel was one of a hopeless child, but as the novel progressed, he became more of a man. In this
      way, he is a very dynamic character. Frenchie is a character who wants to preserve his identity as a Metis person
      more than anything else, and it shows; whenever Rose learns any words from “the language”, he gets very jealous
      wondering “How [she has] language”, and he gets infuriated how “she was the same age as [him], and [that he]
      deserved it more” (Dimaline 38). Frenchie envies Rose whenever she learns the language due to his strong sense of
      identity. Whenever Frenchie is in a situation pertaining to his culture, he is always very serious. Because of his
      seriousness, I started wondering more about my own identity. I come from a Pakistani background, and I have
      visited my home country 4 times. My last trip was in grade 7, and going there was interesting. When I was there, I
      <img class="bottom" src="https://aemagazine.pk/public/posts/210312102709culture.jpg" />
      realised the habits that I and my family still have that are rooted in Pakistani culture: an example is eating
      while sitting on the ground. These habits make me special and I am beginning to appreciate them much more, just as
      Frenchie does. Through Frenchie’s appreciation and struggle for preservation, Dimaline explores the topic of
      Decolonization: meaning challenging stereotypes set on Indigenous peoples such as the “Vanishing Indian”. In The
      Marrow Thieves, the Indigenous peoples are shown as the opposite of the Vanishing Indian: resilient. Furthermore,
      Dimaline utilises allusion in reference to real Indigenous beliefs. Languages like Cree are spoken by characters
      in the novel and ancestry such as Metis is also discussed. This personally creates a more real atmosphere and
      makes everything more meaningful. Through Dimaline’s constant mentioning of identity, I have come to realise its
      importance and how it shapes me as a person. I now understand why Frenchie and everyone else are fighting so hard
      to preserve their culture: culture is what makes you special and it is how you live your life.

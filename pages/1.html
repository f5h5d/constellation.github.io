        Reading The Marrow Thieves opened my eyes to the significance of
        identity; during my reading, identity was a topic that was relevant
        throughout the whole novel. The struggle the characters constantly go
        through to preserve their culture made me wonder more about my own
        heritage; up until then, I did not value my culture, but during my
        reading, I had moments of reflection. Moments of reflection where I
        thought about my culture and how it shapes me as a person: I realised
        the effects it has had on my habits and decision making. Through my new
        found realisation, I was able to sympathise with Dimaline’s characters
        and their fight to preserve their identity. My perception of Frenchie
        during the beginning of the novel was one of a hopeless child, but as
        the novel progressed, he became more of a man. In this way, he is a very
        dynamic character. Frenchie is a character who wants to preserve his
        identity as Metis person more than anything else, and it shows; whenever
        Rose learns any words from “the language”, he gets very jealous
        wondering “How [she has] language”, and he gets infuriated how “she was
        the same age as [him], and [that he] deserved it more” (Dimaline 38).
        Frenchie envies Rose whenever she learns the language due to his strong
        sense of identity. Whenever Frenchie is in a situation pertaining to his
        culture, he is always very serious. Because of his seriousness, I
        thought further about my own identity. I come from a Pakistani
        background, and I have visited my home country 4 times. My last trip was
        in grade 7, and going there was interesting.

        />When I was there, I realised the habits that me and my family still
        have that are rooted in Pakistani culture: an example being eating while
        sitting on the ground. These habits make me special and I am beginning
        to appreciate them much more, just as Frenchie does. Through Frenchie’s
        appreciation and struggle for preservation, Dimaline explores the topic
        of Decolonization: meaning challenging stereotypes set on Indigenous
        peoples such as the “Vanishing Indian”. In The Marrow Thieves, the
        Indigenous peoples are shown as the opposite of the Vanishing Indian:
        resilient. Furthermore, Dimaline utilises allusion in reference to real
        Indigenous beliefs. Languages like Cree are spoken by characters in the
        novel, and ancestry such as Metis is also discussed. This personally
        creates a more real atmosphere and makes everything more meaningful.
        Through Dimaline’s constant mentioning about identity, I have come to
        realise its importance and how it shapes me as a person.

        Hunting By Stars was written in a very different direction from where I
        thought a sequel to The Marrow Thieves would go: instead of being a
        story of payback that I thought it would be, it challenged morality and
        further dives into the topic of identity. My reasoning for my thinking
        is that during the end of The Marrow Thieves when the group was trying
        to save Minerva, I was getting feelings of reclamation, so I assumed the
        sequel would build on that, but I was wrong. When Frenchie is put into
        the terrible predicament of having to choose between sacrificing two of
        ‘his people’ to return to his family, or remaining at the facility and
        losing his Metis identity, I felt terror: thinking about what I would do
        in Frenchie’s shoes made my brain hurt. Frenchie’s decision of sacrifice
        gave me mixed feelings: happiness that he might see his family, but
        sadness that he would sacrifice two of ‘his own’. There is irony in that
        Frenchie’s overarching goal is to preserve his culture, but he chooses
        to sacrifice two Indigenous people for his objective. This ironic
        situation helped me to learn more about Frenchie’s personality as you
        learn the most about a person's morals when they are in a tough
        situation. Therese’s reaction of “What the f*** is going on” (Dimaline
        246) created a tone of awkwardness that made me cringe so hard I had to
        put the book down. This tone adds the majority of the intensity that I
        felt while reading this whole section of the novel. Additionally, after
        just Sunny remained near Frenchie, “she was gazing up at [him] again—no
        judgement, no fear, just wide-open eyes” (247). I was having more mixed
        feelings due to this dilemma: I felt guilty that Sunny was going to be
        sacrificed, but I was happy that Frenchie was going to escape.

        />I rarely feel this type of emotion, but whenever I do, negative
        feelings are felt no matter which decision is made: it is just a
        terrible situation. After finishing the chapter, I took a moment to
        reflect on what I had just read: I thought about what I would do in
        Frenchie’s situation. I concluded that although it would be difficult, I
        would choose to do the same as Frenchie did: sacrifice people I do not
        know for my benefit. Through my reflection, I learned that I might be
        more of an opportunist than I had originally thought. Going back to the
        novel, this whole section is a massive morality question similar to the
        trolly dilemma, but Frenchie’s situation is a little different as his
        decision can be interpreted as the emerging topic of greed. Frenchie
        greedily chose himself over the lives of two people, choosing individual
        freedom over collective survival. This is a decision that will stay with
        Frenchie forever and will have a major effect on his identity as a Metis
        person.

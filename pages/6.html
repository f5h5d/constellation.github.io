        Before going on this field trip, I knew the importance of the
        environment and how we have to save it, but I honestly did not care that
        much about it. Before this field trip, I had never gone camping, if you
        can call this camping, or ever been sitting around a fireplace telling
        stories. It was a very fun experience and one that was enhanced by the
        beauty of nature. When I first heard about the English trip, it was not
        my intention to go, but I decided otherwise due to a friend’s compelling
        argument as to why it was a trip worth experiencing. She
        enthusiastically expressed how the trip was fun when with friends and
        how the activities were interactive and enjoyable. Her reasons convinced
        me and I am thankful for her convincing because I also found the trip to
        be very enjoyable. My favourite part was definitely when we were all
        near the fire and were being told star stories. Although I do not
        remember exactly what was said in the stories, I still do remember the
        experience itself. Being in complete darkness with only the light and
        sound of the fire was calming and soothing; in other words, it was
        therapeutic. The landscape and scenery were amazing and I began to
        realise why we should try to protect the environment at all costs: it
        houses trillions of species, helps us as humans, and is just beautiful
        to look at. This was my first time being out in the wilderness with a
        campfire, and I feel like it helped me connect with Indigenous people
        more because I understood at that moment their belief in the
        interconnectedness of people and nature. They understand that human
        actions directly affect nature, and they make sure to waste as little as
        possible. Additionally, through sharing star stories, we are upholding
        the personal sovereignty of the Indigenous peoples. We are recognizing
        and endorsing the different world views that Indigenous peoples have,
        and the traditions they follow by learning more about them. By putting
        Indigenous teachings/learnings into the curriculum, we are spreading
        their culture and getting rid of racist stereotypes that are put on
        them; all of the stereotypes mentioned in the poem “Future We In-U-Wee”
        are examples of racism. Thinking about star stories reminds me of an
        Inuit story we looked at in class: the story of Sedna. Sedna was the
        daughter of two Giants, but she quickly outgrew them to the point where
        there was not enough food on the land to satisfy her hunger. Because of
        this, her parents took her to the middle of the ocean and threw her
        overboard, cutting off each of her fingers when she grabbed the edge of
        the canoe when she tried to save herself. Each cut-off finger turned
        into a different sea creature, and she became the goddess of the sea.

        />This story relates not only to Inuit peoples but Indigenous peoples in
        general as it portrays the importance the Indigenous peoples put on
        their relationship with nature. All the activities we did were done
        outside, and the reason for that is because of how important nature is
        in Indigenous cultures. Through our experiences outside, I realised the
        importance of nature and why the Indigenous peoples view it as sacred.
        The story of Sedna shows the give-and-take relationship the Indigenous
        peoples have with it, when the Indigenous peoples take care of the land,
        the land/sea gives back to them in the form of resources and food. After
        experiencing the field trip, I have gained more appreciation for the
        beauty of nature and how important it is. The field trip captures a
        portion of Indigenous culture and it is something I believe everyone
        should experience as it is an eye-opening experience.
